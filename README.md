# SignalSpectre - Real-time Signal Analysis and Visualization in Go

SignalSpectre is a Go-based tool for capturing, analyzing, and visualizing time-series data, enabling real-time monitoring and insights into complex systems. It provides a robust framework for handling streaming data, performing signal processing operations, and presenting the results through interactive dashboards. This tool is designed to be scalable and adaptable, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, from network monitoring to industrial process control.

SignalSpectre aims to bridge the gap between raw data streams and actionable intelligence. It achieves this by providing a modular architecture that allows users to easily integrate custom data sources and signal processing algorithms. The core of the system is built around a high-performance data ingestion pipeline that can handle large volumes of data with minimal latency. This data is then processed using a flexible signal processing engine that supports a variety of operations, including filtering, smoothing, and spectral analysis. Finally, the results are visualized through a customizable dashboard that allows users to monitor key metrics and identify anomalies in real-time.

The primary benefit of SignalSpectre is its ability to provide timely and accurate insights into complex systems. By combining real-time data ingestion, advanced signal processing techniques, and intuitive visualization tools, SignalSpectre empowers users to make informed decisions quickly and efficiently. Whether you are monitoring network traffic, analyzing sensor data, or optimizing industrial processes, SignalSpectre provides the tools you need to stay ahead of the curve. Its Go implementation ensures performance and cross-platform compatibility, making it suitable for deployment in a variety of environments.

Key Features:

*   Real-time Data Ingestion: Supports multiple data sources via configurable input plugins. This includes TCP sockets, UDP streams, and file-based data. Data is parsed and pre-processed efficiently using Go's concurrency features.
*   Signal Processing Engine: Includes a library of common signal processing algorithms, such as FFT (Fast Fourier Transform), moving average filters, and peak detection. Algorithms are optimized for performance using Go's math/cmplx and gonum libraries.
*   Customizable Dashboards: Provides a web-based interface for visualizing data in real-time. The dashboard can be customized with various charts and graphs using libraries like Plotly or Echarts.
*   Alerting System: Configurable alerting rules trigger notifications when data exceeds predefined thresholds. Integrates with external services such as Slack or email via webhooks. Alert definitions are stored in a YAML configuration file.
*   Modular Architecture: The system is designed with a modular architecture, allowing users to easily add custom data sources, signal processing algorithms, and visualization components. New modules can be dynamically loaded at runtime.
*   Data Persistence: Optionally persists data to a time-series database (e.g., InfluxDB, Prometheus) for historical analysis and reporting. Supports configurable data retention policies.
*   API for External Integration: Provides a REST API for programmatic access to data and system configuration. The API is documented using Swagger/OpenAPI.

Technology Stack:

*   Go: The core programming language, providing performance, concurrency, and cross-platform compatibility.
*   Gin: A high-performance web framework used for building the REST API and serving the dashboard.
*   Plotly/Echarts: JavaScript libraries for creating interactive charts and graphs in the dashboard.
*   InfluxDB/Prometheus (Optional): Time-series databases for storing and querying historical data.
*   YAML: Used for configuration files, such as alert definitions and input plugin settings.

Installation:

1.  Ensure you have Go (version 1.18 or later) installed and configured correctly. Verify by running `go version` in your terminal.
2.  Clone the SignalSpectre repository from GitHub: `git clone https://github.com/uhsr/SignalSpectre.git`
3.  Navigate to the project directory: `cd SignalSpectre`
4.  Download dependencies: `go mod download`
5.  Build the application: `go build -o signalspectre`
6.  The executable file `signalspectre` will be created in the project directory.

Configuration:

SignalSpectre uses environment variables and YAML configuration files for customization.

*   `SIGNALSPECTRE_PORT`: Specifies the port number for the web server (default: 8080).
*   `SIGNALSPECTRE_CONFIG_FILE`: Specifies the path to the main configuration file (default: config.yaml).

The `config.yaml` file contains settings for data sources, signal processing algorithms, alerting rules, and dashboard configurations. An example configuration file is provided in the repository. Refer to the documentation for details on the configuration options.

Usage:

1.  Run the application: `./signalspectre`
2.  Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080` (or the specified port) to access the dashboard.
3.  Configure data sources and signal processing algorithms using the `config.yaml` file.
4.  Monitor the real-time data and configure alerts as needed.

The REST API documentation can be accessed at `http://localhost:8080/swagger/index.html` (if Swagger/OpenAPI is enabled).
